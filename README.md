# Sustainable Yield Farming Protocol

A decentralized platform connecting crypto yield farmers with real-world agricultural projects on the Stacks blockchain. This protocol enables sustainable agriculture funding while providing crypto holders with yield farming opportunities backed by real-world agricultural yields.

## Overview

The Sustainable Yield Farming Protocol bridges the gap between DeFi yield farming and traditional agriculture by:
- Allowing farmers to access decentralized funding for sustainable agricultural projects
- Providing crypto holders with yield farming opportunities backed by real agricultural outputs
- Creating a transparent and efficient marketplace for agricultural financing

## Features

- **Smart Contract-Based Lending**
    - Automated loan issuance and repayment
    - Yield calculations based on real-world crop performance
    - Multiple pool support for different agricultural projects

- **Real-World Integration**
    - Farmer registration and verification
    - Crop yield tracking and reporting
    - Performance-based reward distribution

- **Risk Management**
    - Minimum stake requirements
    - Pool duration limits
    - Emergency shutdown capabilities
    - Owner-controlled administrative functions

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v16 or later
- npm or yarn
- Stacks CLI
- Clarity CLI

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sustainable-yield-farming.git
cd sustainable-yield-farming
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

## Usage

### For Farmers

1. Register as a farmer:
```clarity
(contract-call? .sustainable-farming register-farmer 
    u1              ;; farmer-id
    u100            ;; total-land (acres)
    "wheat"         ;; crop-type
)
```

2. Update yield estimates:
```clarity
(contract-call? .sustainable-farming update-yield-estimate
    u1              ;; farmer-id
    u5000           ;; new-estimate (bushels)
)
```

### For Yield Farmers

1. View available pools:
```clarity
(contract-call? .sustainable-farming get-pool u1)
```

2. Stake tokens:
```clarity
(contract-call? .sustainable-farming stake-tokens
    u1              ;; pool-id
    u1000000        ;; amount (microSTX)
)
```

3. Claim rewards:
```clarity
(contract-call? .sustainable-farming claim-rewards u1)
```

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
npm test
```

Run specific tests:
```bash
npm test -- -t "Farmer Registration"
```

Generate coverage report:
```bash
npm test -- --coverage
```

## Contract Deployment

1. Build the contract:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Deploy to testnet:
```bash
stx deploy_contract -t sustainable-farming.clar
```

3. Deploy to mainnet:
```bash
stx deploy_contract -m sustainable-farming.clar
```

## Security Considerations

- All funds are managed through smart contracts
- Owner-only functions for critical operations
- Emergency shutdown mechanism
- Real-time yield tracking and verification
- Minimum stake requirements to prevent spam
- Time-locked pools for stability
